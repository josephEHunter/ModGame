<!-- I want to make an rpg game with character selection:
        characters will have abilities and level up:

player object constructor{
class:
hp:
mp:
str:
dex:
int:
}
mage:
warrior:
theif:


the layout of the game will be a random generated box grid that will be called a
dungeon. moving and menu navigation will be on arrow press event.

look up how to generate an interactive grid maybe using p5.

generate random enemy on random squares

on enemy create function for battle start
            battle function attack player/enemy
                            skills player/enemy
                            maybe magic

            player gains exp
                when level gained stats increase static or random by how much

            round end function maybe onclick

we will have randomly generated enemies with increasing dificulty towards the end

create enemy stats range that increases on squares moved or enemies defeated
      either way going to need a counter function

enemy constructor{
name:
hp:
mp:
str:
dex:
int:
}
slime:
goblin:
wyvern:
tekato:
intructor:

to win the game you will have to defeat the "boss"> random generated between
different types like dragon, warewolf, perscholas etc lol -->

<!-- enemy constructor{
name:
hp:
mp:
str:
dex:
int:
}

dragon:
warewolf:
perscholas:

game start function
on death funtion
game win function
restart function
-->
